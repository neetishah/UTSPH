News Theme
===

This project uses a starter _ s theme to develop my own theme. To use it, you can simply download this zip file and upload it to WordPress. 

It creates a custom post type "news," displays them on the home page, utilizes basic css styling, and provides "internal" and "external" categories for News Posts.
